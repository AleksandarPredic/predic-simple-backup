# Very very simple backup WordPress plugin
I am making this plugin for my needs and for small sites that don't need fancy plugins for backup jobs. This plugin zip whole WordPress and add database dump into zip. 
I'll be using this plugin to manually backup some of my sites that do not have many changes. If You find this plugin usable feel free to download the code :)

# Installation
Just install as any other plugin. Visit "Very Simple Backup" admin menu page and click "Backup now" button. Download created files. That's it!!! 
Please don't forget to delete backed up files when You download them.
